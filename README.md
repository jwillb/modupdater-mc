# modupdater-mc

A web-crawler based mod updater for updating Minecraft mods from curseforge to their latest versions.

## Prerequisites
- Minecraft installed with mods (Obviously)
- If using from source, you will need:
  - to install selenium via pip/pip3 with the command ```pip3 install selenium``` on Linux and ```pip install selenium``` on Windows
  - Python 3.8 installed, from [the python.org website](https://python.org)  

This does not currently and will not ever work with mods from sites that aren't [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/).
